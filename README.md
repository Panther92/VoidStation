# VoidStation

English · **[Deutsch](README.de.md)** · [voidstation.de](https://voidstation.de/en/) · [Download](https://voidstation.de/en/download/) · [Questions](https://github.com/Panther92/VoidStation/discussions) · [Report a bug](https://github.com/Panther92/VoidStation/issues)

Void Linux as a TV station: a dark tile interface in the style of Windows 8, controlled with a gamepad, remote, mouse or keyboard.
It runs on Openbox; the start screen is a dedicated Python + Qt 6 program that draws straight on the GPU.
The installer in the live system is Qt as well. The previous web interface (WebKitGTK) remains available as a fallback (Settings → System → Interface).

**Features:** YouTube (Firefox in kiosk mode), radio with search and favorites, TV channels from around the world (iptv-org),
emulators, an AppCenter for optional apps (xbps, Flatpak, AppImage, web), settings (language, scaling, resolution,
audio output, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, mouse pointer), a Samba share `\\<hostname>\share`, several apps side by side with switching.
Interface in **English or German** (Settings → Language · Sprache).
The display server is [XLibre](https://github.com/X11Libre/xserver) (packages from [xlibre-void](https://github.com/xlibre-void/xlibre));
X.Org is not used. If the interface fails to start twice, VoidStation reinstalls XLibre once;
after that, a rescue console appears. By hand: `sudo /usr/local/sbin/voidstation-pkg xserver ensure|repair|status`.
Remote access via SSH can be switched on and off under Settings → System.

## Installation

VoidStation is installed **exclusively from the live ISO**:
**[Download at voidstation.de](https://voidstation.de/en/download/)** (hosted on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/voidstation/files/)).

1. Download the ISO and verify it (see [Verifying the download](#verifying-the-download)).
2. Copy it onto a [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net) stick or write it with [Rufus](https://rufus.ie) / [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io).
3. Turn off Secure Boot, boot from the stick, pick the language in the boot menu and then *Start VoidStation Live*
   (with NVIDIA from GTX 16xx / RTX 20xx on: *… (NVIDIA only)*).
4. Try out the live system, then use the **Install VoidStation** tile: whole SSD, next to Windows or Linux,
   into free space or partitioned manually with GParted. About five minutes, no internet needed.

**Minimum:** 64-bit PC (x86_64), 4 GB RAM, 16 GB on the SSD, Secure Boot off.

## Live ISO with installer

The live ISO is a complete VoidStation to try out (YouTube, TV, radio, VLC) with the **Install VoidStation** tile.
The installer uses the same tile design, in English or German, and copies the live system to the SSD –
it doesn't need internet for that.

- **Paths:** whole SSD · next to Windows or Linux (NTFS, ext4 or btrfs is shrunk) · into free space
  (e.g. next to FreeBSD) · manual partitioning with GParted. With several systems there is a short GRUB boot menu;
  next to Windows, the hardware clock runs on local time.
- **Minimum:** 64-bit PC, 4 GB RAM, 16 GB on the SSD, Secure Boot off. If something is missing, the installer says what to do.
- **Boot mode:** UEFI supports every path. In BIOS mode (Legacy/CSM, e.g. older PCs or VirtualBox/QEMU with
  default settings) only “whole SSD” is available: GPT with a BIOS boot partition, GRUB for BIOS and additionally
  for UEFI – the SSD then boots in both modes.
- **Boot menu of the stick:** with logo – first the language (*Deutsch* / *English*, sets interface, installer and keyboard),
  below it *Start VoidStation Live* (free drivers) and *… (NVIDIA only)* (NVIDIA driver for GeForce GTX 16xx / RTX 20xx
  and newer) · *Reboot*. A splash screen with the logo appears while booting.
  Installing from “NVIDIA only” keeps the NVIDIA driver in the installed system – otherwise the installer removes it
  again (along with DKMS and the compiler).
- **Errors:** Every step can be retried, the boot manager also “another way” (fallback loader instead of an NVRAM entry).
  Log: `/run/voidstation-installer/install.log`, can be saved to a USB stick.
- **Terminal:** `sudo voidstation-installer text` (whole SSD only) · `probe` shows what the installer detects.

### Verifying the download

Next to every ISO on SourceForge there is a `.sha256` file and its signature `.sha256.sig`:

```sh
sha256sum -c voidstation-<version>-<date>.iso.sha256
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panther92/VoidStation/stable/keys/voidstation-release.pub \
  | awk '{print "voidstation-release namespaces=\"voidstation\" "$1" "$2}' > voidstation-signers
ssh-keygen -Y verify -f voidstation-signers -I voidstation-release -n voidstation \
  -s voidstation-<version>-<date>.iso.sha256.sig < voidstation-<version>-<date>.iso.sha256
```

On Windows: `certutil -hashfile voidstation-<version>-<date>.iso SHA256` and compare with the sum on the download page.

### Building the ISO

On a Void system (e.g. a VoidStation), takes 25–50 minutes:

```sh
sudo bash dist/build-iso.sh
```

The ISO ends up in `~/share/ISO/` (with `.sha256`); your own radio and TV favorites come along.

## Updates

**On the TV:** Settings → Updates → *Update* – the only update button. It checks and installs everything in one go:
Void packages (including the kernel), Flatpaks, AppImages, Proton-GE and VoidStation itself (in that order; anything
up to date is skipped). Devices check shortly after startup and then every 6 hours on their own. New VoidStation
versions are announced right away at the bottom right – the update brings pending system updates along. System-only
updates are only flagged once the system has been out of date for 30, 60 or 90 days (Settings → Updates →
*Remind about system updates after*, default 90). The update dialog shows what's new and which packages are coming.
Your tiles, favorites and settings are kept. A restart is only requested after a new kernel or a new VoidStation version.

**In the terminal:** `vsctl update` does the same as the button (with a live log). `sudo xbps-install -Su`
updates only the Void packages – that still works, and VoidStation notices it (finished updates disappear from
the display, after a new kernel “Restart required” appears at the bottom right). VoidStation itself is not an
xbps package and only comes via the button or `vsctl update`.

**Channels:** *Stable* (branch `stable`, default) or *Testing* (branch `main`, new versions first) –
switchable under Settings → Updates → Update channel.

**Signatures:** Updates run as root, so devices only install updates signed with the publisher's key
(`ssh-keygen -Y`, namespace `voidstation`). The public key is in `keys/voidstation-release.pub` and comes onto
the device with the ISO.

## Controls

| | Controller | Keyboard | Mouse |
|---|---|---|---|
| Move | D-pad / left stick | arrow keys | point, wheel scrolls |
| Open / select | A | Enter | click |
| Back | B | Esc / Backspace | right click |
| Close program, favorite | X / Y | Del, F, Y | ✕ on the tile |
| Next / previous group | RT / LT | PgDn / PgUp | arrows at the top right |
| Volume down / up | LB / RB | − / + | |
| Open update (when shown at the bottom right) | Select | U | click the hint |
| Power off | Start | – | ⏻ at the top right |
| Back to the start screen (from any program) | Guide / Home | Win | |

The arrows at the top right appear as soon as a page is wider than the screen; the bright dot shows the current group.
When updates are waiting (or a restart is needed after a new kernel), a yellow hint appears at the bottom right.

## Languages

All interface texts live in `launcher/web/i18n/de.json` and `en.json` (key → text, `{name}` = placeholder).
In code: `T('key', { name })` for texts, `L(text)` for tile, group and app names.
New texts always go into **both** files – `build.sh` aborts if a key or placeholder is missing in `en.json`.

- Choosing the language: Settings → Language · Sprache. Without a choice, the session's `LANG` applies (`en_US…` → English, otherwise German).
- Programs started from tiles get `LANG`/`LANGUAGE` of the chosen language (VLC, PCManFM, GTK/Qt); Firefox profiles get
  `intl.locale.requested` and `intl.accept_languages` before every start. Programs with their own language setting (Steam, Kodi) keep it.
- Tiles: German default names (e.g. “Fernsehen”) are translated via `labels` in `en.json`; your own names stay as they are.
  Your own tiles can be bilingual too: `"label": {"de": "Fernsehen", "en": "TV"}`.
- AppCenter: descriptions via `app.<id>.desc` in `en.json`, otherwise the text from `catalog.json` applies; post-install
  hints (`note` in the catalog) via `app.<id>.note`. Categories come from `categories` in `catalog.json` (order =
  sidebar, name via `labels`, subtitle via `apps.catDesc.<category>`); the interface builds “Installed” itself.
- English means `en_US`: 12-hour clock (8:15 PM), dates and numbers in US format.

## Themes

**Settings → Appearance → Color scheme** offers several themes (e.g. `Dark`, `Light`, `High contrast`, `Nord`). The chosen theme is stored in `settings.json` and survives updates.

### Adding your own theme (drop-in)
New themes can be dropped in as a CSS file at `launcher/web/themes/<theme-name>.css`:

```css
/* launcher/web/themes/matrix.css */
:root[data-theme="matrix"] {
  --bg-main: #051008;
  --bg-radial-1: #0d2814;
  --bg-radial-2: #020a04;
  --surface-base: #0a1f10;
  --surface-raised: #10331b;
  --surface-card: #143d20;
  --surface-card-hover: #1c542c;
  --surface-active: #00ff66;
  --text-primary: #a3ffc2;
  --text-secondary: rgba(163, 255, 194, 0.75);
  --border-focus: #00ff66;
  --border-subtle: #1c542c;
  /* ... */
}
```

VoidStation picks up new CSS files in the theme folder automatically and offers them in the settings.

## Games, Bluetooth, program guide

- **Games:** copy ROMs into the share under `share/ROMs/<system>` (`gba`, `snes`, `nes`, `psx`, `psp`, `nds`, `gamecube`, `dreamcast` …). The emulator tile then shows a game list; without games, the emulator starts directly.
- **Bluetooth:** Settings → Bluetooth. Comes with `bluez` and `libspa-bluetooth` (audio via PipeWire); the user is in the `bluetooth` group. VoidStation runs its own pairing agent over D-Bus: “Just Works” is confirmed, legacy PIN devices get 0000/1234/1111, keyboard codes are shown on screen; requests are only accepted during a scan (+3 min). With several adapters the newest Bluetooth version wins (override: address in `/usr/local/share/voidstation/bt-adapter`).
- **Controllers:** udev rules give Steam, emulators and SDL direct access (hidraw, uinput) to controllers from all common brands. The start page understands standard pads, plain USB pads, joysticks and arcade sticks; custom mapping in `~/.config/voidstation/pads.json` (`{"<name or vid:pid>": {"<evdev code>": "a|b|x|y|lb|rb|lt|rt|select|start|up|down|left|right"}}`).
- **Program guide (EPG):** off by default. Turn it on by entering the address of an XMLTV file (`.xml` or `.xml.gz`):
  `echo 'https://…/epg.xml.gz' | sudo tee /usr/local/share/voidstation/epg-url`
  The file is downloaded daily, parsed in the background and cached as a small `~/.local/share/voidstation/cache/epg.json`.

## On the device

- Customize tiles: `~/.local/share/voidstation/tiles.json`
- Logs: `~/.local/share/voidstation/logs/`
- Switch the interface: Settings → System → Interface (or via SSH: `echo web > ~/.local/share/voidstation/frontend; pkill -f voidstation-home.py`)
- Web interface in Firefox instead of WebKit: `touch ~/.local/share/voidstation/use-firefox`

Trying things out without publishing: `OUT=/tmp/vs ./build.sh`.
Qt interface without Void: `python3 tools/qt-preview.py` (needs `pip install PySide6-Essentials`), installer: `--live`
(plus `--fail` for the error page, `--bios` for BIOS mode).
Regenerating the screenshots (sample data, no Void needed, German and English): `python3 tools/qt-screenshots.py`
(needs `pip install PySide6-Essentials pillow` and the Noto Sans font).

## Publishing (maintainer)

Builds are made and signed on the maintainer's machine with `tools/publish.sh` – that's where the private key lives.

```sh
git config --global credential.helper store      # once: remember GitHub access (token)
echo "alias vspub='bash ~/VoidStation/tools/publish.sh'" >> ~/.bashrc   # once, then log in again
vspub --init-key                                 # once: create signing key (back it up!)
vspub                                            # take the bundle from ~/share/Updates, build, sign,
                                                 # push to main (Testing channel)
vspub --release                                  # release the Testing state to everyone (stable)
vspub --iso                                      # newest live ISO from ~/share/ISO to SourceForge
```

`vspub --iso` checks the ISO's checksum, signs the `.sha256` with the release key (`.sha256.sig`), uploads everything
via rsync to `frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/voidstation/<version>/` (an interrupted upload resumes on the next
run), switches the download on voidstation.de (`site/config.json`) and then deletes the ISO locally. Best run inside
`tmux`. Needed once: add an SSH key at SourceForge and enter it in `~/.ssh/config`
(`Host frs.sourceforge.net` · `User <SourceForge name>` · `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/sourceforge`).
Afterwards, mark the ISO as *Default Download* in the browser.

New versions get an entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md` (`## 0.4.1 – YYYY-MM-DD` plus bullet points)
and the same entry in English in `CHANGELOG.en.md` – if it's missing, `build.sh` aborts.
`dist/` is generated only by `publish.sh` and never edited by hand.
Forks put their own address into `update-url` and create their own key.
If a `codeberg` remote is set up, `publish.sh` keeps it updated as a mirror (the project's former home).

## Website (voidstation.de)

The website lives in `site/` and is built with `tools/build-site.py` (Python 3 only, no third-party packages).
GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) builds and publishes it on every push to `main` or `stable` –
so `vspub` is enough to update it.

- **Pages:** `site/pages/<page>.de.md` and `.en.md` (Markdown, first line `# Title`, first paragraph = lead).
  Links to other pages as `seite:hilfe#bedienung`; blocks like `{{iso}}` stand alone on a line.
- **News:** every version from `CHANGELOG.md`/`CHANGELOG.en.md` on the `stable` branch appears automatically.
  Own posts: `site/news/YYYY-MM-DD-name.de.md` (+ `.en.md`), first line `# Title`.
- **ISO download:** in `site/config.json` under `iso` – `vspub --iso` fills it in itself.
- **Screenshots:** from `docs/screenshots/`, English pages use `docs/screenshots/en/`.
- **Legal notice:** `site/impressum.json`. As long as name and e-mail are missing, the workflow only publishes an
  under-construction page (plus the update channels). The postal address (`street`, `city`) is optional and appears once filled in.
- The domain also serves the update channels `/stable/dist/` and `/main/dist/`.

Previewing without publishing:

```sh
python3 tools/build-site.py --preview      # --preview shows everything, even without a legal notice
python3 -m http.server -d _site 8000       # then http://<host>:8000
```
