# Features

Everything you need from the couch – on a small PC next to the TV, with no account and no ads in the system.

## Interface {#interface}

- Tiles in the style of Windows 8, sorted into groups – add your own tiles
- Control it with a gamepad, remote, mouse or keyboard; controllers from Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, 8BitDo & co., plain USB pads and joysticks – also via Bluetooth, pairing without a keyboard
- On-screen keyboard for every input field – in Firefox and on YouTube too
- Themes: Dark, Light, High contrast and Nord; your own themes as a single CSS file
- Adjustable scaling and resolution, 60 Hz preferred
- German or English, including the programs it launches
- Several programs at once – <kbd>Guide</kbd> or <kbd>Win</kbd> takes you back to the start screen from anywhere

## TV {#tv}

- Free-to-air channels from all over the world (channel list by [iptv-org](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv)), with search and favorites
- Program guide with the current and next show, once an XMLTV source is configured
- Pluto TV and the German public broadcasters' media libraries (ARD, ZDF, ARTE) in the AppCenter

## Radio {#radio}

- Tens of thousands of stations via [radio-browser.info](https://www.radio-browser.info), with search and favorites
- The radio tile shows the station and current track – the radio keeps playing while you use other tiles

## YouTube and streaming {#streaming}

- Full-screen YouTube (Firefox in kiosk mode), optionally with the TV interface
- Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Joyn, RTL+ and Twitch from the AppCenter – copy protection (Widevine) is enabled for them
- Kodi, Jellyfin, Plex HTPC, Spotify, FreeTube and VLC for your own collection

## AppCenter {#appcenter}

60 hand-picked apps in seven categories – install and remove with one click:

- **Gaming:** Steam with Proton-GE, Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris, itch, Prism Launcher (Minecraft), Moonlight, Steam Link, Discord
- **Emulators:** DuckStation, PCSX2, PPSSPP, Dolphin, Cemu, Flycast, mGBA, melonDS, Azahar, Snes9x, Nestopia, Rosalie's Mupen GUI, MAME, DOSBox Staging, ScummVM, VICE, Stella, RetroArch
- **Games:** SuperTuxKart, SuperTux, Neverball, Luanti, Xonotic, Hedgewars, Battle for Wesnoth, OpenTTD
- **Media, streaming, browsers and tools:** from Kodi to LocalSend (send files from your phone)

Native Void packages come first; Flatpak or AppImage only where no Void package exists. “Installed” shows everything on the device – including programs installed from the terminal.

## Games {#games}

- Native Steam from the Void repositories, Proton-GE is kept up to date automatically
- Emulator tiles list the games from the shared folder (`share/ROMs/<system>`) and launch them directly
- Stream games from your gaming PC with Moonlight or Steam Link

## Updates {#updates}

- One button for everything: Void packages including the kernel, Flatpaks, AppImages, Proton-GE and VoidStation itself
- VoidStation updates are signed – devices only install what the publisher has signed
- Channels **Stable** (for everyone) and **Testing** (new versions first)
- No daily nagging: plain system updates are only flagged after 30, 60 or 90 days; a restart is only requested when it is needed

## Under the hood {#technology}

- [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org) (glibc, rolling release) with runit, Openbox and PipeWire
- [XLibre](https://github.com/X11Libre/xserver) display server; if the interface fails to start twice, VoidStation repairs itself, then offers a rescue console
- The start screen is a lean WebKitGTK app – around 250 MB of RAM
- Windows share `\\<hostname>\share` for movies, music and ROMs; remote access via SSH if you want it
- Live ISO with an installer in the same tile design: whole SSD, next to Windows or Linux, into free space or manual partitioning
