VoidStation – live system with installer
========================================

Booting
  Plug in the stick and pick it in the PC's boot menu (usually F12, F11 or Esc) –
  preferably the entry starting with "UEFI:". Secure Boot must be off.
  Older PCs and virtual machines without UEFI boot in BIOS mode (Legacy) – that
  works too, but then VoidStation can only be installed on a whole SSD.

Boot menu
  First pick the language: Deutsch, English, Français – all others (Čeština, Español, Italiano,
  Latviešu, Magyar, Nederlands, Polski, Português (Brasil), Română, Slovenčina, Türkçe, Ελληνικά,
  Русский, Українська, 日本語, 한국어, 简体中文, 繁體中文) are under "Other Languages".
  Then one of the two entries below it:
  Start VoidStation Live                 live system (nothing gets installed), open graphics drivers
  Start VoidStation Live (NVIDIA only)   with the NVIDIA driver – for GeForce GTX 16xx, RTX 20xx and newer
  Reboot                                 restart
  The language applies to the interface, the installer and the keyboard (English: US layout; Greek,
  Russian, Ukrainian: plus US, Alt+Shift switches); change it in the live system under Settings and
  for the installed system in the installer. Esc goes back.
  In BIOS mode the menu can't show every letter: Greek, Russian and Ukrainian appear in Latin letters
  there and their start entries in English.
  With an NVIDIA card, boot "NVIDIA only" and install from there – the installed system then
  gets the NVIDIA driver too. If the interface doesn't come up that way, use the first entry.

Installing
  Tile "Install VoidStation" – or in a terminal: sudo voidstation-installer text
  Minimum: 64-bit PC, 4 GB RAM, 16 GB on the SSD. UEFI or BIOS (Legacy).
  Ways: whole SSD, next to Windows/Linux (shrink), into free space, manual (GParted).
  In BIOS mode only "whole SSD" is available; the SSD then boots in both modes.

Log
  /run/voidstation-installer/install.log (live system),
  /var/log/voidstation-install.log (installed system)
