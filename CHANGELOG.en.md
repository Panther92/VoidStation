# Changes

English version of `CHANGELOG.md`, shown in the update dialog when the interface is set to English.
Same format and the same version headings: `## <version> – <YYYY-MM-DD>`, followed by bullet points.

## 0.15.0 – 2026-10-07
- Bluetooth rebuilt: VoidStation now handles pairing itself, no keyboard needed – headphones, controllers and joysticks using “Just Works” are confirmed, older devices that need a PIN automatically get 0000, 1234 or 1111. Until now such devices failed silently
- Keyboards that ask for a code while pairing: the code is shown at the bottom right until pairing is done
- Other devices cannot pair on their own – requests are only accepted during a scan and for 3 minutes after it
- Scanning takes 30 instead of 10 seconds; found devices stay selectable for 3 minutes. If a device has disappeared in the meantime, a short rescan runs before pairing
- Cleaner list: phones, PCs and TVs nearby and devices without a name no longer show up. Instead each entry says what it is (audio, controller, keyboard, mouse) and – where the device reports it – the battery level
- Error messages with a reason (“Device is not responding – is it in pairing mode?” instead of just “Pairing failed”) and a hint on how common devices enter pairing mode (AirPods, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch)
- Headphones: sound switches to them right after connecting
- Two Bluetooth adapters (e.g. a USB dongle in addition to the built-in chip): the newer one is used, the other is switched off. To pick one: put its address in `/usr/local/share/voidstation/bt-adapter`
- Bluetooth blocked by the radio switch: “Turn on” lifts the block
- Controllers that forgot their pairing (reset, other device) pair again without “Unpair” first; headphones reconnect faster
- Start page: plain USB pads without their own driver, joysticks and arcade sticks now control the interface too. Custom mapping via `~/.config/voidstation/pads.json`
- Steam, emulators and SDL games may access controllers from all common brands directly (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Valve, 8BitDo, Logitech, Hori, PDP, PowerA, Thrustmaster, GameSir and more, over USB and Bluetooth) – previously PlayStation only

## 0.14.3 – 2026-10-05
- Old kernels are removed automatically once the system runs fine with the newest kernel (interface up for 10 minutes) – saves about 300 MB per kernel
- Direct boot (EFISTUB): if the firmware rearranges the boot order itself (e.g. always GRUB first), it is left that way instead of being overwritten on every kernel update – GRUB also starts the newest kernel. To force it: `sudo voidstation-efistub --order`

## 0.14.2 – 2026-10-05
- Kernel updates: the yellow “Restart required” notice stayed after restarting because the PC kept booting the old kernel. Direct boot (EFISTUB) now uses one fixed boot entry, “VoidStation EFISTUB”, that stays the same across kernel updates – the new kernel is placed on the EFI partition under a fixed name
- The initramfs no longer contains graphics drivers (they load later anyway) – about 200 MB smaller per kernel; the EFI partition was almost full. Old kernel files are removed from it
- If a kernel doesn’t fit on the EFI partition, GRUB starts automatically with the newest kernel
- Existing devices are switched over during the update (the initramfs is rebuilt once, then restart once)
- If a new kernel still doesn’t start after a restart, Settings → Updates shows a note instead of the permanent notice
- Updates: instead of “Update server not reachable” right after starting, the check now runs immediately; without a network it says “offline – no internet connection”, and the server message only appears when the network is up and the server really doesn’t answer

## 0.14.1 – 2026-10-04
- English interface: the clock shows “2:53 PM” again in the afternoon instead of “14:53 PM”

## 0.14.0 – 2026-10-04
- The installer is now a Qt program as well: the live system and the installation run without WebKit – smooth even with the NVIDIA driver in 4K, mouse included
- All paths as before: whole SSD, next to another system (move the boundary with the d-pad or drag it with the mouse), free space, manual partitioning with GParted; account and hostname via the on-screen keyboard or a real keyboard; “hold A” to install; progress, error page with “Try another way” and log
- “Wi-Fi” in the installer opens the Wi-Fi settings directly
- Stick boot menu: pick the language first (Deutsch / English), then the two boot entries in that language – interface, installer and keyboard start out matching (English with a US keyboard)
- The page arrows at the top right work again (they had no effect with the Qt start page)
- The web interface stays as a fallback: if the Qt interface fails to start three times, it takes over – in the live system too

## 0.13.3 – 2026-10-03
- Wi-Fi: a wrong password now shows “Wrong password? Please enter it again.” instead of the raw nmcli message, the field is cleared and the on-screen keyboard opens again; “network not found”, “not responding” and “no Wi-Fi adapter” are shown in plain words too
- Wi-Fi: connecting with a password replaces an old saved profile for the same network, and a failed attempt no longer leaves a half-made profile behind (it used to block the next attempt)

## 0.13.2 – 2026-10-03
- Keyboard and gamepad no longer jump back to the tile under the mouse pointer – the mouse only sets the focus when it is moved

## 0.13.1 – 2026-10-03
- Wi-Fi: scanning gets enough time for USB adapters (instead of “nmcli not available”), connecting waits up to 90 s; country radio rules (wireless-regdb package, country from the time zone), no random MAC while scanning and no power saving – helps many USB adapters
- Keyboard: the interface uses the layout chosen in the installer (it was always German before, e.g. wrong with a US keyboard)
- elogind no longer restarts every second (“elogind is already running” flooding the console); booting via GRUB without a flood of messages
- Web interface (live system, installer, “Classic”) with the NVIDIA driver: runs in Firefox instead of WebKit – smooth even in 4K
- Live ISO: the boot menu never runs in 4K (barely reacted to keys on some NVIDIA cards), 15 s countdown; the regular entry reliably blocks the NVIDIA driver, and the installer only keeps it when the card really uses it

## 0.13.0 – 2026-10-03
- New start page as a program of its own (Python + Qt 6) instead of a web page in WebKit: draws directly on the graphics card – also with the NVIDIA driver and in 4K – and needs less memory
- Everything as before: tiles, radio, TV with programme info, games, AppCenter, settings, on-screen keyboard and themes, controlled by gamepad, keyboard and mouse
- Settings → System → Interface: switch between “New (Qt)” and “Classic (web)”. If the new interface fails to start three times, the classic one takes over automatically
- The live system and the installer keep the web interface for now

## 0.12.1 – 2026-10-02
- No more dark screen while starting: until the home screen is ready it shows the logo with loading dots – seamlessly following the boot splash
- The home screen starts earlier (no longer waits for audio and the launcher), and the background is dark grey from the start instead of black
- Live ISO: boot splash with logo in BIOS mode (Legacy/CSM) too, instead of text messages

## 0.12.0 – 2026-10-02
- Home screen on NVIDIA cards: the interface picks a suitable rendering path by itself (no DMA-BUF on NVIDIA, no GPU at all if none is available) and steps down to a safer mode after repeated crashes – instead of a black screen with a mouse pointer
- Live ISO: new boot menu with logo in the tile design, just “Start VoidStation Live”, “Start VoidStation Live (NVIDIA only)” and “Reboot” (UEFI and BIOS)
- Live ISO: NVIDIA driver included (GeForce GTX 16xx, RTX 20xx and newer) – only loaded via “NVIDIA only”; the regular entry uses nouveau with GSP firmware
- Live ISO: boot splash with logo
- Installer: installing from “NVIDIA only” keeps the NVIDIA driver; otherwise it is removed along with DKMS and the compiler. Boot splash and GParted stay on the stick

## 0.11.1 – 2026-10-01
- The on-screen keyboard opens for every input field, also on mouse click – and now in Firefox/YouTube too (“FX OSK” extension, works offline)
- PlayStation controllers (DualSense/DualShock) via Bluetooth; the D-pad also works on controllers that report it as an axis
- Logos and tiles can no longer be dragged by accident, no text selection while navigating
- Installer: the size split next to another system can be dragged with the mouse
- Thanks to DevSpeX!

## 0.11.0 – 2026-10-01
- Installation also works in BIOS mode (Legacy/CSM): older PCs and virtual machines with default settings (VirtualBox, QEMU) no longer need UEFI. BIOS mode offers “Use the whole SSD”; installing next to other systems and manual partitioning remain UEFI-only
- An SSD installed in BIOS mode also boots when the firmware is later switched to UEFI (GRUB for both modes)
- The stick's boot menu now offers “Install VoidStation” and the English entries in BIOS mode too
- The installer only requires Secure Boot to be off; the instructions for that are shorter

## 0.10.1 – 2026-10-01
- AppCenter: visible scrollbars next to the categories and the apps, so you can tell there is more; the category list fades out at the bottom when more follows

## 0.10.0 – 2026-10-01
- AppCenter rebuilt: “Installed” and the categories on the left, the apps as tiles on the right – the list scrolls down instead of sideways, and the number of columns adapts to resolution and scaling
- “Installed” shows everything on the device at a glance, grouped by category – including programs installed outside the AppCenter
- Controls: up / down switches the category and shows it right away, right goes into the apps, left goes back; LT / RT (PgUp/PgDn) jumps to the previous / next category from anywhere; the mouse wheel scrolls the list
- Much more choice (60 instead of 22 apps), still curated:
  - Gaming: Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris, itch, Prism Launcher (Minecraft), Steam Link, Discord
  - Emulators: PCSX2 (PS2), Rosalie's Mupen GUI (N64), Azahar (3DS), Cemu (Wii U), MAME (arcade)
  - Games: SuperTuxKart, SuperTux, Neverball, Luanti, Xonotic, Hedgewars, Battle for Wesnoth, OpenTTD
  - Media: Jellyfin, Plex HTPC, Spotify, FreeTube, Strawberry; Kodi now comes with controller support and streaming add-ons
  - Streaming: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Joyn, RTL+, Pluto TV, Twitch
  - Browsers: Firefox (normal, with address bar), Chromium, Brave, LibreWolf
  - Tools: Mission Center, LocalSend (send files from your phone), AntiMicroX (controller mapping)
- Streaming apps with copy protection (Netflix & co.) enable Widevine in their Firefox profile
- The AppCenter opens faster: installation status is checked with one call for all apps instead of one per app

## 0.9.0 – 2026-10-01
- Updates in one place: Settings → Updates → “Update” checks and installs everything in one go – Void packages (incl. the kernel), Flatpaks, AppImages, Proton-GE and VoidStation itself; anything already up to date is skipped
- The AppCenter no longer has update buttons, it is only for installing and removing programs
- Devices now also check for system updates (every 6 hours). New VoidStation versions show up right away and bring pending system updates along; system-only updates are flagged at the bottom right only after 30, 60 or 90 days (default 90, Settings → Updates) – no daily nagging on a rolling release. The confirmation lists all packages
- Updates done in a terminal (`sudo xbps-install -Su`) are detected: finished updates disappear from the display, and after a new kernel “Restart required” appears
- A restart is only requested when it is really needed (new kernel or new VoidStation version)
- New in the terminal: `vsctl update` does the same as the button in Settings, with a live log

## 0.8.3 – 2026-10-01
- Settings adapt to every resolution and scale: long lists (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) scroll along instead of disappearing under the hint line; long names wrap
- Page titles shrink when space is tight instead of overlapping the page arrows
- Fixed: at large scales (e.g. 2.25× at 720p) opening Radio could hang the interface (endless re-layout loop)

## 0.8.2 – 2026-10-01
- Settings: the top row of tiles is no longer cut off, and the focus frame on the bottom row no longer covers the hint line

## 0.8.1 – 2026-10-01
- Tidier settings: one tile per area (Language, Display, Appearance, Sound, Network, Bluetooth, Shared folder, Updates, System) – each tile shows the current state, Esc / B returns to the overview
- A pending update shows up on the “Updates” tile; U / Select jumps straight there

## 0.8.0 – 2026-09-30
- Themes: Dark, Light, High Contrast and Nord – under Settings → Display
- On-screen keyboard for search fields and the Wi-Fi password – works with a controller, a remote or a keyboard
- Bluetooth: find, pair, connect and unpair headphones and controllers in Settings (restart once after the update)
- Games: emulator tiles list the games from the share (share/ROMs/<system>) and launch them directly
- TV: program guide (EPG) with the current and next show – as soon as an EPG source is set
- Thanks to DevSpeX for this release!

## 0.7.8 – 2026-09-29
- Installer: the user and root passwords are now actually set – before, both accounts were left without a password and sudo and su failed; the installer now checks this and stops otherwise
- Installed system: the live stick's greeting (“root:voidlinux …”) no longer appears on the text console

## 0.7.7 – 2026-09-29
- Installer: the password for the Windows share “share” is now actually set – before, the share stayed locked (error 0x80004005)
- Dialogs with long text (e.g. “What's new”): the text scrolls with ↑ ↓, the mouse wheel or the D-pad, the buttons always stay visible

## 0.7.6 – 2026-09-29
- Intel PCs load the current CPU microcode at boot (intel-ucode) – fixes freezes on older Skylake machines with an old BIOS; also in the live ISO

## 0.7.5 – 2026-09-29
- Installer: the progress screen appears right after holding (large tile with percentage, steps and explanation) – no going back until the restart
- Installer finished: only “Restart now” remains

## 0.7.4 – 2026-09-29
- Installer: “Erase and install” got stuck – fixed
- mGBA is no longer preinstalled but available in the AppCenter (Games); existing installations keep it
- AppCenter: new section “On this device” – programs installed in a terminal can get a tile
- Image viewer (GPicView) with a black background

## 0.7.3 – 2026-09-29
- No more “update” to an older version (e.g. when Stable is still behind the installed version)
- Live system: no update status in Settings

## 0.7.2 – 2026-09-29
- ISO build: the live-system setup script is now executable (fixes the abort at step 7/13)

## 0.7.1 – 2026-09-29
- ISO build: packages that no longer exist in the Void repositories (e.g. mesa-vdpau) are skipped instead of aborting the build

## 0.7.0 – 2026-09-29
- XLibre is now the only display server – the update removes X.Org, and the choice in Settings is gone
- If the interface fails to start twice, XLibre gets reinstalled once; after that a rescue console follows
- Remote access (SSH) can be switched on and off under Settings → System
- The update channels are now called “Stable” and “Testing” in both languages
- htop, nano, fastfetch and the Mousepad editor are now always included
- New: live ISO with an installer in the tile design – whole SSD, next to Windows or Linux, into free space, or partition manually with GParted

## 0.6.1 – 2026-09-28
- Programs like VLC, the file manager and YouTube start in the selected language
- Arrows at the top right show that there is more to the left or right; one dot per group
- Jump group by group: LT / RT on the controller, Page Up / Page Down on the keyboard
- Update notice at the bottom right with a yellow warning triangle – open it with U or Select on the controller

## 0.6.0 – 2026-09-28
- Language: German or English, switch under Settings → Language · Sprache
- “What's new” is shown in the selected language
- Time, date and numbers in the format of the selected language
- Default tiles are translated too, your own tile names stay as they are

## 0.5.1 – 2026-09-28
- Moved to GitHub (github.com/Panther92/VoidStation) – devices now get their updates from there
- Short command for a fresh install: xbps-fetch https://panther92.github.io/VoidStation/vs

## 0.5.0 – 2026-09-28
- Display server: XLibre instead of X.Org (xlibre-void repository, key pinned)
- Safety net: if the interface fails to start twice, VoidStation automatically switches back to X.Org
- Choose between XLibre and X.Org under Settings → System → Display server

## 0.4.0 – 2026-09-28
- Update channels: “Stable” for everyone, “Testing” to try new versions early
- Updates are signed – devices only install updates with a valid signature
- Automatic update check with a notice on the start page
