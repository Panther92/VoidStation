# Changes

English version of `CHANGELOG.md`, shown in the update dialog when the interface is set to English.
Same format and the same version headings: `## <version> – <YYYY-MM-DD>`, followed by bullet points.

## 0.8.0 – 2026-09-30
- On-Screen Virtual Keyboard (OSD): Full text input using gamepad and remote controls for text fields (Wi-Fi password, station search) with D-pad navigation
- Electronic Program Guide (EPG): Live display of current show with progress bar and upcoming show in the TV player (XMLTV & JSON)
- Bluetooth Manager: Pair, connect, and manage audio headphones and wireless controllers directly in Settings
- ROMs & Games Browser: Emulator tiles open a dedicated game browser reading from the Samba share (share/ROMs/<system>) with direct launching
- Security & Stability Hardening: Safe Wi-Fi password input without process list exposure, dynamic user detection instead of hardcoded "paul", strict error handling in update scripts

## 0.7.8 – 2026-09-29
- Installer: the user and root passwords are now actually set – before, both accounts were left without a password and sudo and su failed; the installer now checks this and stops otherwise
- Installed system: the live stick's greeting (“root:voidlinux …”) no longer appears on the text console

## 0.7.7 – 2026-09-29
- Installer: the password for the Windows share “share” is now actually set – before, the share stayed locked (error 0x80004005)
- Dialogs with long text (e.g. “What's new”): the text scrolls with ↑ ↓, the mouse wheel or the D-pad, the buttons always stay visible

## 0.7.6 – 2026-09-29
- Intel PCs load the current CPU microcode at boot (intel-ucode) – fixes freezes on older Skylake machines with an old BIOS; also in the live ISO

## 0.7.5 – 2026-09-29
- Installer: the progress screen appears right after holding (large tile with percentage, steps and explanation) – no going back until the restart
- Installer finished: only “Restart now” remains

## 0.7.4 – 2026-09-29
- Installer: “Erase and install” got stuck – fixed
- mGBA is no longer preinstalled but available in the AppCenter (Games); existing installations keep it
- AppCenter: new section “On this device” – programs installed in a terminal can get a tile
- Image viewer (GPicView) with a black background

## 0.7.3 – 2026-09-29
- No more “update” to an older version (e.g. when Stable is still behind the installed version)
- Live system: no update status in Settings

## 0.7.2 – 2026-09-29
- ISO build: the live-system setup script is now executable (fixes the abort at step 7/13)

## 0.7.1 – 2026-09-29
- ISO build: packages that no longer exist in the Void repositories (e.g. mesa-vdpau) are skipped instead of aborting the build

## 0.7.0 – 2026-09-29
- XLibre is now the only display server – the update removes X.Org, and the choice in Settings is gone
- If the interface fails to start twice, XLibre gets reinstalled once; after that a rescue console follows
- Remote access (SSH) can be switched on and off under Settings → System
- The update channels are now called “Stable” and “Testing” in both languages
- htop, nano, fastfetch and the Mousepad editor are now always included
- New: live ISO with an installer in the tile design – whole SSD, next to Windows or Linux, into free space, or partition manually with GParted

## 0.6.1 – 2026-09-28
- Programs like VLC, the file manager and YouTube start in the selected language
- Arrows at the top right show that there is more to the left or right; one dot per group
- Jump group by group: LT / RT on the controller, Page Up / Page Down on the keyboard
- Update notice at the bottom right with a yellow warning triangle – open it with U or Select on the controller

## 0.6.0 – 2026-09-28
- Language: German or English, switch under Settings → Language · Sprache
- “What's new” is shown in the selected language
- Time, date and numbers in the format of the selected language
- Default tiles are translated too, your own tile names stay as they are

## 0.5.1 – 2026-09-28
- Moved to GitHub (github.com/Panther92/VoidStation) – devices now get their updates from there
- Short command for a fresh install: xbps-fetch https://panther92.github.io/VoidStation/vs

## 0.5.0 – 2026-09-28
- Display server: XLibre instead of X.Org (xlibre-void repository, key pinned)

- Choose between XLibre and X.Org under Settings → System → Display server
